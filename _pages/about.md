Pin Shuai is an Earth Scientist at [Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL)](https://www.pnnl.gov/science/staff/staff_info.asp?staff_num=9354). He is a quantitative hydrogeologist by training with a background in water resources engineering. His primary research interests include flow and solute transport, groundwater-surface water interactions and biogeochemical processes in the hyporheic zone. At PNNL, Pin is mainly working on the SBR-SFA project titled ["Influences of Hydrologic Exchange Flows on River Corridor and Watershed Biogeochemical Function"](https://sbrsfa.pnnl.gov/), with a focus on reach- and watershed- scale river corridor modeling. He aims to understand the dominant factors that control the dynamic exchange between river and aquifers and their implications on contaminant mobilization, biogeochemical and ecological processes in the Hanford Reach of Columbia River.

Pin received his PhD in geology from Texas A&M University (USA) in 2017, and his MS and BS in water resources engineering from Wuhan University (China) in 2013 and 2011, respectively. Most of his previous work has focused on groundwater-surface water interactions under dynamic river flow conditions and their implications on nutrient and contaminant transport and transformation in the hyporheic zone adjacent to riverbanks. He has used both numerical models and field methods to study nitrate cycling in a dam regulated river in Texas as well as arsenic mobilization in the aquifer under tidal influence in Bangladesh. He gained both hands-on experience and analytical skills through these diverse projects. He hopes to use his expertise in water resource to preserve and protect our environment.

Pin Shuai is a post doctorate research associate at [Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL)](https://www.pnnl.gov/). I am a quantitative hydrogeologist by training with a background in water resources engineering. My primary research interests include flow and solute transport, groundwater-surface water interactions and biogeochemical processes in the hyporheic zone. At PNNL, I am working on the SBR-SFA project titled ["Influences of Hydrologic Exchange Flows on River Corridor and Watershed Biogeochemical Function"](https://sbrsfa.pnnl.gov/), with a focus on reach scale river corridor modeling. I aim to understand the dominant factors that control the dynamic exchange between river and aquifers and their implications on contaminant mobilization, biogeochemical and ecological processes in the Hanford Reach of Columbia River.

I received my PhD in geology from Texas A&M University (USA) in 2017, my MS and BS in water resources engineering from Wuhan University (China) in 2013 and 2011, respectively. Most of my previous work has focused on groundwater-surface water interactions under dynamic river flow conditions and their implications on nutrient and contaminant transport and transformation in the hyporheic zone ajacent to riverbanks. I have used both numerical models and field methods to study nitrate cycling in a dam regulated river in Texas as well as arsenic mobilization in the aquifer under tidal influence in Bangladesh. It is through these diverse projects that I gained both hands-on experience and analytical skills. I would like to use my expertise to preserve and protect our environment.
